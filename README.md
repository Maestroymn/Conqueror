 *GAME FLOW SYSTEM*
 ----------------------------------------------
 This game is coded with Java and there is no specific java-library used on this game. On the menu screen you can see the rules of the game. To play the game in a correct way, all the 3 players have to select their capital city from the world map. In the game, there are 3 default colors for each different player which are red, blue and yellow. After selecting capital cities for each 3 player, then the main game screen should show up after clicking the start game button. On the game screen, the game flow is easy to follow since there is a mini console screen on the game scene which is telling you what is going on at that moment. So, to start a war between 2 countries you need to click "choose attacker" button and then choose your country to attack from, and then you need to click "choose area to attack" button and choose a country to attack. After this step, click "roll attacker dice" to roll for the attacker player and click "roll defender dice" button to roll for the defender player, finally player needs to click attack! button to start the war. And players may follow the turn flow from the screen to see which player needs to play on that turn. And they also can see the current status of each players hp, and they can follow the regions HP after clicking the areas. *If you are feeling confused about the game flow, I suggest you to watch the gameplay video to understand it better.*
